<p>
    There are a few phrases that can make the hair on any developer's neck stand
    straight up.
</p>

<p>
    <ul>
        <li>What do you mean backups?</li>
        <li>I don't need source control, the code is all on my laptop!</li>
        <li>Did I release the wrong build into production?</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    While I have a story for each of those, today, I'm reflecting on the 
    scariest of all. The silent killer. The one who never shows up in testing.
    The one who makes your debugger utterly useless. That one bug that won't
    cause problems for a month, then one day... out of the blue... WHAM!
    <strong><i>Race Condition!</i></strong>
</p>

<p>
    I was writing some code, when one of my colleagues, who is downstream of one
    of the legacy applications I maintain, approached my cubicle.
</p>

<p class="quote">
    Hey Kyle, P said, We are having an issue submitting our development
    jobs to your system. This has been happening for the past month, but 
    since it was only dev jobs, we didn't want to bother you with it. But 
    it has been really annoying that half of our jobs just get dropped
    and we are having a hard time working around this issue.
</p>

<p>
    I felt bad that a system I was responsible for was causing P's team so much
    trouble. Had I known about the issue sooner, I would have jumped right
    on it. But this is strange, why are only half of the dev jobs being rejected?
    Could it be only certain job types that are getting rejected? Is the server
    getting overloaded at different times to cause it to miss requests?
</p>

<p>
    Digging into server logs and checking the past load with <i>sar</i>, I
    found nothing wrong. The server was written in Python, so it's easy to
    check the source code that was deployed and go through it with a fine
    toothed comb. Unfortunately, there was nothing unusual in the source code.
    On top of that, the code had not been changed in at least 6 months, as it
    was a legacy system slowly being phased out.
</p>

<h4>
    Frustrated, I opened my debugger.
</h4>

<p>
    Running the server in PDB and putting breakpoints all over the place, I
    sent test jobs through, watched them get accepted into the system and get 
    submitted to the cluster. All appears normal.
</p>

<p>
    Then one job got picked up by the server, but then nothing. It did not
    get submitted to the cluster. No other breakpoints got hit.
</p>

<p class="quote">
    What's going on here?
</p>

<p>
    Is this a bug in PDB? I've never had problems with the standard Python
    debugger missing breakpoints. I sent the jobs again and again, and some
    would make me hit a breakpoint where the job would be submitted, and some
    would just not hit at all.
</p>

<p>
    Checking the server logs, I could see a line that gets printed out whenever
    the job is submitted. I put several breakpoints at and around where the 
    messages are printed, but even then, sometimes the breakpoint is caught,
    sometimes it isn't, but the log message still appears.
</p>

<h4>
    This is getting spooky.
</h4>

<p>
    I then start changing the text in the log message. Adding some extra debug 
    information should help answer this, right? But now I'm seeing that some 
    jobs have these changes in the log messages, and some don't.
</p>

<p>
    My manager starts getting nervous. We had spent the past couple of hours
    trying to figure out this problem, and we haven't gotten anywhere yet.
    He starts asking me, <i>I thought you knew this system? How can we not
    know what's happening yet?</i>
</p>

<p>
    Getting more frustrated with not being able to explain what's going on,
    I show him. <i>Look here! I even changed the text in the log messages, and 
    in the logs, half of the jobs have the new text, and half of the jobs 
    have the old text. This can't be happening!</i>
</p>

<p>
    <i>Spend some more time with it, and really make sure you know the system</i>,
    my manager told me.
</p>

<p>
    After spending the next several minutes completely dumbfounded, I suddenly
    start to think. <i>Wait a minute, the new server we requested to replace this 
    one... I wonder if there is anything running on it yet.</i> I had
    completely forgotten that we had requested for a new server, as there is
    approximately a one month turn around time between requesting it, and
    actually being able to use it. I dig through my emails to find the hostname,
    log on, check the crontabs, and sure enough, it is set to run the legacy 
    service I had been debugging!
</p>

<p>
    At this point the design of this system is necessary to understand what was 
    happening. This system exposes a TCP port, which receives data via a 
    custom binary protocol. It then writes out this data as an XML file, which
    another process comes by and translates it to JSON and spits it out into another
    file, which another process then picks up and submits it to the cluster...
    and these intermediate files are being hosted on an NFS share.
    <i>(I did not design this monstrosity)</i>
</p>

<p>
    Because there were two instances of this service running on two separate
    machines which have access to the same file share, there was a race
    condition where whichever machine saw a new file appear first would take
    it and try to submit it. However, because only the existing server had been 
    configured to be able to submit to the cluster, only the files that this 
    server picked up got submitted, and the other would fail.
</p>

<p>
    We deleted the crontab from the misconfigured server, and notified the team
    that the problem is fixed. In the end, it didn't cause much damage, and only 
    took a few hours to resolve, but my god are these issues hard to debug!
    Just think, in the unlikely scenario where there was a machine that I didn't 
    know about accidentally had the crontab from my server applied to it, I
    would not have had a chance to figure out the problem.
</p>
