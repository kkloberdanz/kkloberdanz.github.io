<h2 class="posttitle">Convolutions - Where Physics and Machine learning Meet</h2>
<h5>24 Sep 2020</h5>

<p>
    There's a concept in both Physics and Machine Learning called Convolution.
</p>

<p>
    This might seem like a round about explanation, but to understand
    convolutions in machine learning, let's first look at what convolution means
    from a Physics perspective. In Physics and Mathematics, convolutions are
    related to fourier transforms, which are usually applied to waves.
</p>

<p>
    To take a look at the inner workings of waves and fourier transforms, let's
    boot up the trusty oscilloscope.
</p>

<p>
    Starting with the setup, I'm going to plug one end of my headphone cable
    into my laptop, and the other I'll attach my oscilloscope probe to. I'll
    attach the probe to the left audio channel, and I'll ground the probe on the
    ground connector on the audio cable.
</p>

<p>
    Using an
    <a href="https://www.szynalski.com/tone-generator/"
        >online tone generator</a
    >
    , I'll be able to generator audible waves that my oscilloscope will be able
    to display.
</p>

<p>
    Let's look at a simple sin wave. This sin wave is at 440 hz.
</p>
<img class="img" src="image/440hz.jpg" alt="440 hz sin wave" />

<p>Here we have another sin wave, but this time at 330 hz.</p>
<img class="img" src="image/330hz.jpg" alt="330 hz sin wave" />

<p>
    These are pretty boring waves, not much to see here. But let's take a look
    at what happens when we add these waves together.
</p>

<p>
    That looks more interesting! An important thing to know about waves is that
    when you add them together, the <i>y</i> value of the resulting wave is
    equal to the sum of the <i>y</i> values of the 2 operands. So assuming we
    have 2 waves, if at a given point on the <i>x</i> axis one wave has a
    <i>y</i> value of -1 and the other has a <i>y</i> value of 1, then the
    resulting wave will have a <i>y</i> value of 0 at that point <i>x</i>.
</p>

<p>
    I promised a Fourier transform. A Fourier transform is a way to convert from
    the time domain into the frequency domain. What this does is it shows the 
    corresponding frequencies that compose a wave. To demonstrate this, I'll
    set my oscilloscope to display the Fourier transform of these sin waves
    below. The two sets of waves that you see are the original signal on top,
    and the fourier transform of it on the bottom. Notice how the bottom wave 
    has a spike that goes all the way up to the x-axis. This spike indicates
    the frequency of the wave we are looking at. In this case it is spiking
    at the 440hz mark on the x-axis.
</p>
<img class="" src="image/440hz_fft.jpg" alt="440 hz sin wave FFT" />

<p>
    I'll now demonstrate what the Fourier transform looks like when the signal
    is flat, i.e. no signal. You can see that there are no spikes in the fourier 
    transform. You will notice that even with the signal turned off, there is 
    still a small amount of noise that is easy to see when looking at the
    fourier transform. In a perfect world if the signal was completely flat,
    then the fourier transform would also be flat. Here we are seeing the
    messiness of the analog world.
</p>

<p>
    Now, let's do both signals together. There are two bumps! The bump to the
    left indicates 330 hz and the bump on the right indicates 440 hz. If we,
    for example, wanted to amplify one frequency in the wave and filter out
    another, we could do that, and apply an inverse Fourier transform from that
    to construct a wave that has more signal and less noise! Do you see where 
    this is heading?
</p>

<p>
    But what do Fourier transforms have to do with convolutions?
    There is a very interesting property of the convolution
    operator such that the the convolution of <i>f</i> and <i>g</i> is equal to
    the inverse Fourier transform of the Fourier transform of <i>f</i> times the
    Fourier transform of <i>g</i>. This is called the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution_theorem"
        >convolution theorem</a>
    To put this in mathematical notation, you can see a definition of the
    convolution operator, i.e. *, below.
</p>

<div class="formula">
    f * g = F<sup>-1</sup>(F(f) &#xd7 F(g))
</div>

<p>
    What this means is that if we have an input signal and values to use as a
    filter, we can perform the convolution of these items to get out a filtered
    signal with just the particular features that we care about.
</p>

<p>
    Now that we have seen how convolution is related to the Fourier transform,
    let's define how to calculate a convolution. The formula below is how you
    calculate a convolution of two continuous functions, <i>f</i> and <i>g</i>
    over an infinite time range.
</p>

    <img
        class="img"
        src="image/convolution-integral.svg"
        alt="convolution integral definition"
    >
</div>

<p>
    Convolutions are commonly used for feature extraction in image processing.
    Since images are a discrete set of pixels and are finite in their bounds,
    we can simplify the convolution formula to what we see below. Keep in mind,
    and integral is simply a sum over a continuous set, so we can replace the 
    integral with a simple sum in our case of discrete data.

<p>
    Here we can see the result of a convolution being applied to an image.
