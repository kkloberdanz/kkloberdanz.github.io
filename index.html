    Nowadays, most people will recommend that you "go to the cloud" for all of
    your computing needs. While this advice might work for a lot of businesses,
    the cloud can be pretty expensive, especially for individuals who don't need
    constant uptime for their blog. There's also free hosting options for static
    content, such as github.io, but you may quickly outgrow this approach once
    you start wanting dynamic content. If you don't mind spending a couple
    minutes per month keeping your server up to date, self hosting from home can
    be orders of magnitude less expensive than using a cloud service. It's also
    a great learning experience to find out for yourself what it actually takes
    to host a webserver!

    In order to host a webserver, first you'll need a server! Because we don't
    need anything too reliable, we don't need to get a computer with ECC memory
    and redundant power supplies. An old office PC will do!
</p>

<p>
    I picked up my computer, a Dell OptiPlex 980, from a University surplus sale
    several years ago. This sweet rig packs a first generation
    <a href="https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/42915/intel-core-i5750-processor-8m-cache-2-66-ghz.html">i5-750</a>
    from 2009! While you don't want to play modern AAA games on this thing, it's
    more than enough to host my blog! I paid $20 for this beast back in the day,
    but you can easily find a more modern and much more powerful machine on ebay
    for less than $100. This machine has 4 x86_64 cores and a whopping 8 GiB of
    RAM. Let's see how much a similar machine on AWS will cost you...
</p>

<p>
    The cheapest EC2 instance I could find that matches these specs is a 
    c6g.xlarge, which costs $0.136 per hour. Granted, these are much newer cores
    than my machine has, but to reiterate, 3.6 GHz quad core i5 Skylake systems
    can be found on ebay for less than $100, so let's take that as a baseline.
    Also, it's important to note that when AWS sells you a <i>vCPU</i>, they
    really mean half of a CPU, since they enable hyperthreading, and treat a
    single logical core as a single CPU, so in actually a 4 vCPU machine from
    Amazon will really be a 2 core machine.
</p>

<div  style="overflow-x: auto">
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Instance Name</th>
        <th>On-Demand Hourly Rate</th>
        <th>vCPU</th>
        <th>Memory</th>
        <th>Storage</th>
        <th>Network Performance</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>c6g.xlarge</td>
        <td>$0.136</td>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>8 GiB</td>
        <td>EBS Only</td>
        <td>Up to 10 Gigabit</td>
    </tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>
    Calculating out total cost of ownership (TCO) over the course of a year, we
    can find the following:
</p>

<div class="quote">
    $0.136 * 24 hours per day * 365.25 days per year = $1192 per year!
</div>

<p>
    Over the standard three year warranty period of enterprise computer hardware,
    that brings us to $3576. At that rate, you might as well buy yourself a nice
    shiny brand-new enterprise grade server!
</p>

<a href="#an-operating-system">
<div id="an-operating-system">
    <h4>An operating system</h4>
</div>
</a>

<p>
    Any modern operating system will do. I gravitate towards UNIX flavors, so
    that's what I'll discuss today. While I'm a long time Linux user, I've been
    using FreeBSD more and more lately for servers. I like that ZFS comes with
    the base operating system, the installer has easy to configure security
    hardening, and its network stack performance has been blowing me away! This
    guide will mostly work for any Linux distro as well (and probably other
    BSDs), but this guide is targeted at FreeBSD specifically.
</p>

<p>
    You can find many guides for installing FreeBSD. I recommend looking at the
    <a href="https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/bsdinstall/">official documentation</a>
    first. I also recommend literally every book by
    <a href="https://mwl.io/">Michael W. Lucas</a>, and in this particular case
    <a href="https://nostarch.com/absfreebsd3">Absolute FreeBSD</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Towards the end of the FreeBSD installation, you'll come across a page
    asking which security hardening features you would like to enable. Since
    this operating system is going to be exposed to the public internet, I
    recommend selecting <b>all</b> of them!
</p>

<p>
    There are a few more steps that we will want to take in order to secure our
    server. First, we want to require SSH keys and forbid using a password to
    SSH to the server. The reason for this is SSH keys are quite long. A lot
    longer than you could possibly remember for a password. SSH keys are also
    totally random data, which means that they have a lot higher entropy than
    sensible passwords, so it is <i>much much</i> harder to brute force an SSH
    key than it is a password.
    First create an ssh key pair on your primary computer
    (not the server!) then copy the public key to the server, i.e.,
    <span style="font-family: monospace">ssh-copy-id</span>.
    Next, add the following line to the end of
    <span style="font-family: monospace">/etc/ssh/sshd_config</span>
</p>

<div class="codeblock">
    ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
</div>

<p>
    Most SSH attempts happen on port 22. If we change the system's ssh port, we
    can block a lot of script kiddies and automated attacks that look for an
    easy target. Changing the port that SSH listens to is security by obscurity.
    Meaning that it is not good security by itself, but it will at least cut
    down on the amount of SSH attempts you'll see from unsophisticated
    attackers. Once again within
    <span style="font-family: monospace">/etc/ssh/sshd_config</span>, change the
    line that reads <span style="font-family: monospace">Port 22</span> to
    instead have a different number, such as:
</p>

<div class="codeblock">
    Port 1234
</div>

<p>
    For these changes to take effect, restart the SSH service.
</p>

<div class="codeblock">
    $ sudo service sshd restart
</div>

<p>
    The last step in hardening that we'll do is to enable
    <a href="https://www.sshguard.net/">sshguard</a>. sshguard is similar to
    Fail2Ban in Linux, and will protect your server from attackers using brute
    force to try to SSH to your system. You can install it as follows:
</p>

<div class="codeblock">
    $ sudo pkg install sshguard
</div>

<p>
    To enable sshguard, you'll have to add these line to your 
    <span style="font-family: monospace">/etc/rc.conf</span> file.
</p>

<div class="codeblock">
<pre>
sshguard_enable="YES"
sshguard_danger_thresh="30"
sshguard_release_interval="600"
sshguard_reset_interval="7200"
</pre>
</div>

<p>
    Then start the service:
</p>

<div class="codeblock">
    $ sudo service sshguard start
</div>

<p>
    Now that we've taken the reasonable steps to secure our system, let's move on
    to the reason we're doing this in the first place...setting up the
    webserver!
</p>

<a href="#webserver-software">
<div id="webserver-software">
    <h4>Webserver software</h4>
</div>
</a>

<p>
    I'll be installing <a href="https://nginx.org/en/">Nginx</a> as the
    webserver. Nginx is flexible in that it can be used to serve up static
    content but also reverse proxy to other services that you have on your LAN!
    By using Nginx as a reverse proxy, you can keep a smaller attack footprint
    by having your other services less exposed to the internet.
</p>

<a href="https://nginx.org/en/">
<img class="img" src="image/nginx.png" style="width: 25%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block"/>
</a>

<p>
    To install nginx on FreeBSD, simply type:
</p>

<div class="codeblock">
    $ sudo pkg install nginx
</div>

<p>
    From there, all you have to do to enable nginx on startup is to add the
    following line to <span style="font-family: monospace">/etc/rc.conf</span>
</p>

<div class="codeblock">
    nginx_enable="YES"
</div>

<p>
    Run the following to start nginx.
</p>

<div class="codeblock">
    $ sudo service nginx start
</div>

<p>
    And that's all! If you go to your computer's IP address in a web browser, you
    should be greeted with the following screen.
</p>

<iframe src="image/nginx.html" title="Nginx startup page" height="300" width="600" ></iframe> 

<p>
    You can set any HTML files that you want to serve in the directory
    <span style="font-family: monospace">/usr/local/www/nginx</span>.
</p>

<a href="#a-static-ip-address">
<div id="a-static-ip-address">
    <h4>A static IP address</h4>
</div>
</a>

<p>
    This step is highly dependent on which internet service provider (ISP) you
    have. I have
    <a href="https://www.metronet.com/">Metronet</a>, and this is
    <a href="https://support.metronet.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043558513-WHAT-IS-A-STATIC-IP-AND-HOW-DO-I-ADD-ONE-TO-MY-SERVICES-">
        their guide</a>
    to getting a static IP address as a part of their service. For me, it only
    costs an additional $10 per month to have a static IP address. Well worth it
    compared to the costs of alternatives! The way how the process worked for
    me, is I called customer support to add a static IP address to my package.
    After 5 business days my IP address was allocated and ready to be used. I
    simply had to call customer support to do the cut over, and I updated my
    router's configuration to use the static IP address. I have a TP-Link
    router, so I followed
    <a href="https://www.tp-link.com/us/support/faq/560/">this guide</a> for how
    to do this on my router.
</p>

<a href="#a-domain-name">
<div id="a-domain-name">
    <h4>A domain name</h4>
</div>
</a>

<p>
    Certainly the easiest part of this whole setup is getting a domain name. I
    used
    <a href="https://domains.google.com/registrar/search">Google Domains</a>
    for my website, but there are many other registrars to choose from. Go ahead
    and search for a domain in the search bar in the link to see if it's
    available. Then you simply purchase the domain name!
</p>

<p>
    Once you have your domain name, you must now update Nginx to use that domain
    name as the <span style="font-family: monospace;">server_name</span>. Edit
    the file
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">/usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf</span>
    and change <span style="font-family: monospace;">server_name</span> to your
    domain name.
</p>

<a href="#a-dns-record">
<div id="a-dns-record">
    <h4>A DNS record</h4>
</div>
</a>

<p>
    After buying your domain name, you'll need to create a DNS entry to point to
    your webserver. Google makes that easy. When you click on your domain name
    in Google Domains, there is a menu bar on the left that has a tab called
    <i>DNS</i>. Here you can create an '<i>A</i>' record with your IP address in
    the data field. Don't know what your IP address is? You can find that
    <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/">here</a>!
</p>

<a href="#port-forwarding">
<div id="port-forwarding">
    <h4>Port Forwarding</h4>
</div>
</a>

<p>
    You will need to forward your webserver to the open internet. In your router
    settings, forward port 80 for HTTP and port 443 for HTTPS traffic. You can
    also forward your SSH port too if you want to be able to SSH to your
    server when you're away from home. Be warned however that the more ports you
    forward, the more you're exposed to the open internet!
</p>

<a href="#tls">
<div id="tls">
    <h4>TLS</h4>
</div>
</a>

<p>
    The last thing we'll need is to configure TLS. TLS is important to keep data
    encrypted while it is in transport to your server. If you do not enable TLS,
    then anyone viewing your website will get annoying messages from their
    webbrowser saying that your website is insecure.
    Getting a TLS certificate is free and easy. I'm using
    <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/getting-started/">Let's Encrypt</a> for
    mine. Navigate to <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/">Certbot</a> and fill in
    the "Software" and "System" fields, then follow the instructions on the
    page. I made a cronjob in
    <span style="font-family: monospace">/etc/crontab</span> to renew my
    certificate every month like so. Certbot will also configure Nginx
    appropriately to use your TLS certificate
</p>

<div class="codeblock">
<pre>
<span style="color: green"># renew certificate</span>
<span style="color: yellow">@monthly</span>	certbot renew
</pre>
</div>

<div id="closing-thoughts">
    <h4>Closing thoughts</h4>

</a>

<p>
    It's really not hard to run your own webserver. It's also really cheap!
    Let's have another look at the cost breakdown. We found that an equivalent
    machine would cost $1192 per year from Amazon. Let's take a look at all of
    the expenses to see how the two options compare in the long run.
</p>

<div  style="overflow-x: auto">
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Item</th>
        <th>Yearly AWS Cost</th>
        <th>Yearly Self-Host Cost</th>
        <th>One-time Self-Host Cost</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Computer</td>
        <td>$1192</td>
        <td>$0</td>
        <td>$100</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Domain Name</td>
        <td>$12</td>
        <td>$12</td>
        <td>$0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Static IP address</td>
        <td>$0</td>
        <td>$120</td>
        <td>$0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>DNS record</td>
        <td>$6</td>
        <td>$0</td>
        <td>$0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Total</b></td>
        <td>$1210</td>
        <td>$132</td>
        <td>$100</td>
    </tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>
    We see that by self hosting, we only have to pay $132 per year. With an
    initial equipment purchase of $100, in the first year we only have to pay
    $232 by self hosting as opposed to $1210 for AWS. Over a 3 year period
    (a typical warranty period for IT equipment), we have an amortized cost of
    $165 per year by self hosting, and $3612 for AWS,
    <i>literally an order of magnitude more expensive!</i> For that much money,
    one could buy a <i>really</i> high end desktop or a mid-level server. One
    must do a careful cost analysis before jumping into the cloud. There are
    scenarios where renting computers from cloud vendors does not make sense
    economically.
